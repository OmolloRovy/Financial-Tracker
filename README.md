# Expense Tracker Application

This README file provides information about the Expense Tracker application, a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## Description

This application allows users to track their expenses effectively. 

**Key Features:**

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization using a robust system ( JWT).
*   **Expense Tracking:**

    *   Expense entries include details such as:
        *   Date
        *   Category (Food, Transportation, Entertainment)
        *   Amount
        *   Description
    *   Ability to categorize expenses for better budgeting.
*   **Expense Visualization:** 
    *   Interactive charts and graphs to visualize spending patterns over time.
    *   Visualize expenses by category, date range, and other relevant criteria.
*   **Financial Reports:** 
    *   Generate detailed reports summarizing spending trends.
    *   Customizable reports based on user preferences and needs.
*   **Budgeting Tools:** 
    *   Set and track budgets for different categories.
    *   Receive alerts or notifications when approaching or exceeding budget limits.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** For building the user interface.
    *   **React Router:** For handling client-side routing.
    *   **[CSS Framework/Library]:** ( Material-UI, Tailwind CSS) for styling.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Express.js:** For building the RESTful API.
    *   **Node.js:** As the runtime environment.
    *   **MongoDB:** As the NoSQL database for storing user data and expenses.
*   **Other Technologies:**
    *   **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for interacting with MongoDB.
    *   **[State Management]:** (Redux, Zustand, Context API) for managing application state.
    *   **[Testing Framework]:** (Jest, Mocha) for unit and integration testing.

## Project Structure

*   **client:**
    *   Contains the React frontend code.
    *   Includes components, pages, styles, and other frontend-related files.
*   **server:**
    *   Contains the Express.js backend code, including API routes, database models, and middleware.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
3.  **Install server-side dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```
5.  **Install client-side dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
6.  **Start the development server:**
    *   Start the backend server: `npm start` (or `nodemon server.js`)
    *   Start the frontend development server: `npm start`

**Note:**

*   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in environment variables.
*   **Database Setup:** Set up a MongoDB database instance (e.g., using MongoDB Atlas) and configure the connection string in your environment variables.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests for both frontend and backend components to ensure code quality and maintainability.
